# esp8266-luaminimal
A minimal set of lua scripts to get a telnet server running on an ESP8266.

This set of files can be used as a starting point for writing a new software module, or for bootstrapping a new or
freshly flashed device via the serial port. Larger projects can be copied via telnet after reboot using
[luatool](https://github.com/jmechnich/luatool).
